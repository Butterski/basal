# What is new in basal 2.3 (not released yet)

- **basal-omni in `--mode eager` computes a request's state once for all its questions.** The eager backend runs
  Gemma 4 through the engine's own forward (`basal/gemma4.py`, transformers' modules and weights): a request's state
  and media run once and every question and option order runs over them, the image and audio encoders once per
  request, and mini's 18 KV-sharing layers only where the answer is read. On one H100 at 16 requests in flight, five
  questions over a 3k-10k-token state: mini 1.6 -> 15.3 questions/s, max 0.7 -> 4.5; one question: mini 10.0 -> 17.2
  decisions/s. Agreement with the 2.2 forward on dev v2: 1.000 (mini) and 0.9997 (max) on decisions with margin >=
  0.2. `--eager-forward hf` keeps the 2.2 path. [OMNI.md](OMNI.md#what-the-engine-does-differently-for-gemma-4)
- **`--eager-attn auto` (opt-in, basal-omni in `--mode eager` on Hopper):** FlashAttention 3 in the sliding-window
  layers and the memory-efficient kernel (keys and values copied per head) in the 512-wide global layers. One H100 at
  16 in flight, against the default math kernel: mini 17.2 -> 24.4 decisions/s and 15.3 -> 19.0 questions/s over long
  states, max 5.0 -> 8.7 and 4.5 -> 7.6. Top answers equal to the 2.2 forward on 0.9995 (mini) and 0.9991 (max) of the
  dev v2 decisions with margin >= 0.2.
- **`--ple-offload on` (basal-omni mini, `--mode eager`):** the 5.6 GB per-layer embedding table stays in host memory
  and only the rows of each forward's tokens go to the GPU: 5.2 GB less GPU memory at about 4% fewer decisions per
  second, the same answers. For mini on smaller GPUs.
- **`--mode eager` avoids a torch attention bug.** Before torch 2.14.1, SDPA's memory-efficient kernel returns wrong
  attention for keys and values expanded from one key / value head at some query lengths (pytorch/pytorch#191937):
  transformers passes such a view with an attention mask, and basal-omni-1.0-max was off by 6.2 in code log-prob on a
  1,857-token prompt. The eager backend now runs every model's transformers forward without that kernel on CUDA with
  older torch (2.2 did so for Gemma 4 only).

- **basal-omni in the CUDA graph engine, 3.4-6x eager** (`--mode fast`, the default on CUDA; text). Gemma 4 runs
  through the engine's own layer code: SOAM's packed row and two passes over its sliding-window and global layers (the
  window is a condition on positions inside the trie mask), key / value buffers per layer type, E4B's KV-shared layers
  and the last own-key layer at the answer rows only, the fp32 readout with the softcap. On Hopper: FlashAttention 3 in
  the sliding layers, FlexAttention in the 512-wide global ones, merged projections, compact rows, compiled; elsewhere
  the math kernel of `--mode eager` (`--gemma-attn`). One H100, against `--mode eager`: 1.1-max 16.2 vs 4.8 decisions
  per second on single questions (vLLM bf16: 16.7) and 10.6 vs 0.7 questions per second with five questions over a long
  state; mini 61.2 vs 10.0 and 21.4 vs 1.6; ultra 6.1 vs 2.0 and 4.8 vs 0.3. Same answers within bf16 rounding (dev
  v2: 0.998-0.999 of the top answers at margin >= 0.2; with the shipped calibration files the automated share at 1%
  within 0.1 points). [OMNI.md](OMNI.md#what-the-engine-does-differently-for-gemma-4)
- **Less GPU memory for basal-omni in the graph engine:** 8 MB cuBLAS workspaces per captured graph
  (`CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG` unless set; 32 MB each by default), no image / audio towers (text only), and long states
  keep only the sliding layers' last window of keys and values (ultra's 10k-token states ran out of memory on 80 GB).

- **Faster preparation of large requests.** The prompt language is detected from the state once per request in task
  expansion and once in question preparation, not once per question: an English state was re-scanned for Polish
  diacritics for every question (a 40k-character `compress` request with 326 questions: 509 ms, now 2 ms; 50 task
  questions: 79 ms, now 2 ms in task expansion). Same languages as before. Contributed by Milosz (@Butterski),

# What is new in basal 2.2

**Engine v2.2.0: calibration on your own data, for every basal model**
- **Task thresholds from your labels.** `basal-calibrate` now takes labelled `classify`, `verify` and `extract`
  questions and certifies the `automated` flag of their answers (`task_thresholds`), by the same bound as the decision
  types, on the answers as served. A file with task questions only keeps the decision calibration and adds the task
  thresholds. [CALIBRATION.md](CALIBRATION.md#tasks-classify-verify-extract)
- **`extract` fields report `automated`**, like `classify` and each `verify` claim.
- **A few dozen labels are enough to start.** Below `--min-per-type` decisions, a type's temperature is blended with
  the shipped one in proportion to the labels you have (`--min-blend`, from 10), instead of being left as shipped.
- **Your data, measured as served.** The report shows how the file you would otherwise serve (the shipped one, or
  `--calibration FILE`) does on your held-out decisions: the share it automates at each target and its error, each
  type at the threshold basal-serve applies (2.1 compared the pooled threshold, which basal-serve does not apply to
  prompt-format-2 models). `--report-only` prints the report without writing a file.
- **A file knows its model.** `fitted_on` records the model and its Hugging Face revision; `basal-serve --calibration`
  warns when a file was fitted on another model or revision (and reports it in `GET /v1/models`), and
  `--strict-calibration` refuses it.
- **Measured on a new domain** (basal-omni-1.0-mini on typed-decisions, test split): the shipped file's 1% setting
  would automate 12.6% of decisions at 8.0% error there; calibrated on the train split, the calibration error falls
  from 0.268 / 0.106 / 0.104 to 0.083 / 0.073 / 0.052 (choice / yes-no / score) and nothing is automated above its
  target. [The example](CALIBRATION.md#example-a-new-domain-measured)
- **Fix:** a looser `max_error` target no longer keeps a stricter threshold than a tighter one (the scan could stop
  early at 5% and automate fewer decisions than at 1%); also in the task thresholds.
- **basal-omni on GGUF and MLX (text only).** `--mode gguf --gguf <file>` runs a GGUF conversion of basal-omni-1.0
  through llama.cpp (Metal, CUDA or CPU; llama-cpp-python 0.3.36 or newer) and `--mode mlx` / `mlx-q8` the bf16
  weights through mlx-lm on Apple Silicon. Q8_0 and Q6_K pass the port gate against bf16; Q5_K_M and Q4_K_M do not.
  `--mode gguf` loads `CALIBRATION.gguf.json` when the model ships one. [OMNI.md](OMNI.md#gguf-llamacpp-ollama-and-mlx-text)
- **New model repositories:** `-GGUF` (Q8_0, Q6_K) and `-FP8` (`--mode vllm`) of basal-omni-1.0-mini and -max, each with
  a calibration fitted on the port's own readouts (GGUF: on Q8_0); 8-bit `-MLX` ports (`--mode mlx`,
  `CALIBRATION.mlx.json`) of 1.0-mini, 1.0-max and 1.1-max. `VLLM_BATCH_INVARIANT=1` gives repeatable answers
  in `--mode vllm` ([OMNI.md](OMNI.md#serve)).
- **From the community.** `basal-export-gguf` (Piotr Durlej, #8; extra `basal[gguf-export]`) converts a basal model
  to GGUF, or repairs an existing GGUF file, with the tokenizer fix of the `-GGUF` files, so that llama.cpp and Ollama
  tokenize like the Hugging Face tokenizer ([GGUF.md](GGUF.md#convert-yourself)). Two experimental,
  community-maintained engines for the Llama-architecture models (basal-1.5, basal-2.0), both opt-in: `--mode tpu`
  (Kuba Sołtys, #15; extra `basal[tpu]`) in JAX / XLA on a Google TPU, and `--mode strix` (Michał Kardyś, #14) with
  Triton kernels for AMD Strix Halo. Their numbers in [HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md) are the contributors' measurements.
  `basal-viz` (@lukaspoloki, #2) opens a local page that shows every step of a decision, next to the served answer
  ([SERVING.md](SERVING.md#see-how-a-decision-is-made)).
- Every other request takes the same code path as in v2.1.0.

# What is new in basal 2.1

**Engine v2.1.0: task types (experimental)**
- Four task types on the same API, for the basal models you already serve (no new model): **`classify`** (labels with
  a rubric each), **`verify`** (is each statement supported, contradicted or not stated by the state), **`compress`**
  (the sentences, lines or paragraphs needed for a question, as shorter text for another model) and **`extract`** (a
  JSON schema filled with values taken exactly from the document, with character offsets).
- Each task is expanded into the decision types over the shared state, so it costs about as much as the decisions it
  asks: no text is generated, and `extract` values are always exact text of the document.
- Measured on public sets the models were not trained on, with basal-omni-1.0-max: see
  [TASKS.md](TASKS.md#results). Experimental: the API may change, and the `automated` flag of a task answer needs
  thresholds fitted for that task.
- Every other request takes the same code path as in v2.0.0 (on basal-omni-1.0-max, 23,276 of 23,278 served-check
  answers were the same; the two others were near-ties).

**New models (Hugging Face, Sat 17 Oct, 09:00 CEST)**
- **basal-omni-1.0-ultra** (31B, Gemma 4 31B; text and images): Werdykt 0.879, the highest of the basal models; and
  **basal-omni-1.0-ultra-FP8** for `--mode vllm` (text only).
- **basal-omni-1.1-max** (*experimental*): basal-omni-1.0-max with extra training on the task formats, better on the
  tasks and slightly behind 1.0-max on general decisions; 1.0-max stays the default ([TASKS.md](TASKS.md#results)).

# What is new in basal-2.0


**Models**
- A family of three: **basal-2.0-mini** (1.5B, fastest), **basal-2.0** (4.5B, main model, with an experimental
  thinking mode) and **basal-2.0-max** (11B, most accurate). Weights in bf16, plus **FP8** (NVIDIA Hopper and
  Blackwell), **GGUF** (Ollama, llama.cpp) and **MLX 8-bit** (Apple Silicon).
- **Prompt format 2**: up to **255 options per question** (basal-1.5: 10), read in one forward pass with **one option
  order** by default (basal-1.5 read two orders). See [FORMATS.md](FORMATS.md).
- On **Werdykt**, the hidden Polish–English decision benchmark, every tier is above its basal-1.5 counterpart (+1.2 /
  +0.7 / +1.1 points for mini / 4.5B / max) with a lower calibration error (0.035 / 0.060 / 0.044 against
  0.086 / 0.068 / 0.074), and faster. Not everything improved: on a panel of 10 public English decision tasks all three
  are below basal-1.5 (−2.1 / −3.6 / −1.8 points). All numbers: [results against basal-1.5](RESULTS.md#results-against-basal-15).
- **Calibration** with a temperature per question type and option-count bucket, fitted on question families the model
  was not trained on. It is cautious on new tasks: the shipped files certify a 5% error target but no 1% target (one
  port file excepted), so `max_error: 0.01` defers every decision ([using the confidence](API.md#using-the-confidence)).
- **Thinking mode** (4.5B, *experimental, off by default*): `--think auto` writes a short reasoning note for uncertain
  questions before deciding. On Werdykt it lowered accuracy and calibration and cut throughput; we recommend leaving it
  off ([thinking mode](THINKING.md#thinking-mode-experimental)).

**basal-omni-1.0 (experimental): images and audio**
- Two models on Google Gemma 4: **basal-omni-1.0-mini** (4B, Gemma 4 E4B) and **basal-omni-1.0-max** (12B). They answer
  the same typed questions over the same API, and with `--media on` a request may also carry **images and audio**
  (`"media"`).
- On Werdykt: 0.769 (mini) and 0.823 (max), against 0.721 for basal-1.5 (4.5B) and 0.773 for basal-1.5-max.
- Trained on text decisions only: Gemma 4's own encoders read the images and audio zero-shot, and media answers use
  the text calibration. `--mode eager` only for now. See [images and audio](INSTALL.md#images-and-audio-basal-omni-experimental)
  and [OMNI.md](OMNI.md).

**Engine v2.0.0**
- **Faster serving on one GPU**: compact batching (single prompts packed into one row with FlashAttention 3 varlen),
  the prompt template computed once at start-up, a scheduler that keeps long requests from delaying short ones,
  merged projections and FlashAttention 3 on Hopper, native ModelOpt FP8 checkpoints in `--mode fp8`.
- **One engine for text and media**: the eager backend serves the basal-omni models (Gemma 4 architecture) and, with `--media on` and
  the `basal[media]` extra, requests with images and audio (`"media"`, `"detail"`, `"lang"`). In every model it now
  reads option codes in fp32, reads left-padded prompts at their own positions and prefills long prompts in
  2,048-token chunks.
- **New question type `tool`**: the next tool (or answer directly / ask the user / no suitable tool) from OpenAI, MCP
  or Anthropic tool definitions, also as a set of tools (*experimental*).
- **MCP for agents** (*experimental*): `basal-serve --mcp on` also serves the decisions as an MCP server at `/mcp`
  (tools `decide` and `decide_many`), and `basal-mcp` connects a running server to agent hosts over stdio
  ([MCP](MCP.md#mcp-basal-as-a-tool-for-agents)).
- **`multi`** gains set objectives (`iou`, `f1`, `exact`) and `exclusive` / `fallback` labels.
- **`basal-calibrate`**: fit the temperatures and certified confidence thresholds on your own labelled requests.
- **`--deterministic`** serving (answers independent of load), **`--orders 1 | 2 | auto`**, long states truncated in
  the middle instead of refused (`--context-overflow`), option-code logits in fp32 in every backend.
- The engine still serves basal-1.5 and basal-1.0 models (prompt format 1) with the same API.
